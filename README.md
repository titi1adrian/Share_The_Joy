This project is focused on class hierarchy

The ultimate goal is to obtain a generic system capable of:

- use several types of surprises (i.e. that implement a common interface)
- implement various algorithms for storing and giving surprises
- use a strong, random mechanism to generate a (new) set of surprises

There are three types of surprises : FortuneCookie, Candies and MinionToy. These surprises can be stored in three types of bags : Random, LIFO and FIFO based on the way we can extract the surprises.
